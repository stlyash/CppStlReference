# C++ STL Reference Redefined
I wanted to create a simple C++ STL Documentation app in Electron for everyone, to make C++ STL easier to understand and implement.
## Running while Developing
### Running
Run ```npm start``` in the terminal to run the app while it in the development.
### Reloading
This framework doesn't support hot-reloading. Which means, the program will not automatically reload while you make the changes. Hence, type ```rs``` in the terminal and press enter to restart the app, in the same terminal where you have ran ```npm start```.
## Contribution
**Please don't create a PR directly**, I would appreciate it if you create an issue for the changes you will be making to the app, get assigned to that issue and then start working on it.
